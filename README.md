## California Temperatures & Precipitation

Interactive scatter plots that display 50 years of weather data from six locations across California: (1) the number of days with maximum temperature greater than 90 degrees Fahrenheit, and (2) the annual precipitation in inches. Built with Vue.js, Chart.js, and Mapbox. [View working component](https://sean-kelliher-california-temps-precip.netlify.app).

## Project Status

Project meets general accessibility (WACG) and cross-browser requirements. More testing with a dedicated services (e.g., Sauce Labs) would be helpful if deploying to production.

## About NOAA's API
Originally, I built this app to fetch data from NOAA using the agencyâ€™s API. But, the API was not always reliable and repeatedly fetching historical data that would never change seemed foolish. I rebuilt the app, storing NOAA's data locally.
