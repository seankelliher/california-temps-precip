## California Temperatures & Precipitation

Charts that display information on precipitation and temperatures in California cities, 1970 - 2020. The cities are San Diego, Los Angelos, Bakersfield, Fresno, Graton, Stockton, and Eureka. These sites were chosen because they had complete data, and represent different regions of California. The charts were built with Chart.js 3.5.1. The data is from the National Centers for Environmental Information, part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).
